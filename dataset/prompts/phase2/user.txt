Generate {n_samples} Persian samples for emotion classification.

Distribution requirement:
- 30% clear and obvious cases
- 40% subtle and implicit cases
- 30% hard boundary cases (emotion could be confused with another label but one is dominant)


Target labels:
- Withdrawal
- fear
- other

Detailed label definitions:

Withdrawal:
Texts where the person shows behavioral or psychological withdrawal from social interaction or participation.

Typical signals include:
- Avoiding meetings, gatherings, or conversations
- Ignoring messages or calls
- Preferring isolation over interaction
- Canceling plans repeatedly
- Feeling too tired or unwilling to interact with others
- Emotional distancing from friends or family
- Desire to stay alone instead of joining social activities

Important notes:
- Withdrawal focuses on avoidance behavior, not necessarily sadness or fear.
- Person may not explicitly say they are avoiding people; avoidance can be implied.
- Social disengagement or reduced participation is key.

fear:
Texts where fear, anxiety, worry, or anticipation of danger or negative outcomes is dominant.

Typical signals include:
- Fear of events, situations, or outcomes
- Anxiety about health, work, future, or safety
- Physical or emotional tension caused by worry
- Expectation that something bad might happen
- Nervousness or panic before events
- Fear-driven hesitation or stress

Important notes:
- Fear may be explicit or implied.
- Anxiety about uncertain outcomes counts as fear.
- Fear does not require social withdrawal; it can occur while still interacting socially.

other:
Texts that do not clearly express Withdrawal or fear.

Typical examples include:
- Neutral daily experiences
- Anger, happiness, sadness, excitement, nostalgia, or mixed emotions
- Descriptions without dominant fear or social avoidance
- Normal social participation without avoidance signals

Important notes:
- Use this label only when fear or withdrawal cues are absent or weak.
- If signals are ambiguous, prefer "other".
- A significant portion of "other" samples should include anger or frustration.
- Ensure that at least 40–50% of "other" samples contain anger or frustration-related content.


Dataset requirements:

Each sample must contain:
- "text": natural Persian text
- "reason": explanation showing how emotion is inferred
- "label": one label from the list above

Text diversity requirements:
- Mix short, medium, and longer texts.
- Include direct and indirect emotional expression.
- Use diverse daily-life contexts:
  work, family, school, friendship, loneliness, uncertainty, home, street, social media chat, online forum, etc.
- Some samples should express emotion subtly.
- Avoid repeated scenarios or sentence openings.

Advanced diversity constraints:

Context diversity:
Ensure variation in:
- Age (teenager, university student, middle-aged employee, elderly)
- Occupation (student, worker, freelancer, parent, unemployed, etc.)
- Living situation (alone, with family, dorm, shared apartment)
- Urban vs small-town settings
- Online vs offline interactions

Trigger diversity:
For each label, use varied emotional triggers.
Do NOT repeat the same trigger pattern.

Expression diversity:
- Some texts must express emotion explicitly.
- Some texts must imply emotion only through behavior or tone.
- Some texts must contain mixed emotions but one dominant label.

Structural diversity:
Include variation such as:
- Short 1–2 sentence texts
- Medium 3–5 sentence reflections
- Longer paragraph-style thoughts
- Dialogue format
- Complaint-style message
- Diary-style entry
- Social media post tone
- Formal tone
- Casual chat tone

Lexical diversity constraint:
Avoid repeatedly using common emotional phrases such as:
"می‌ترسم", "حوصله ندارم", "نمی‌خواهم", "استرس دارم"
Use varied phrasing and synonyms.

Hard case construction:

For Withdrawal:
- Some samples should contain mild worry but dominant social avoidance.
- Avoid making them purely fear-driven.
- Social disengagement must be the key signal.

For fear:
- Some samples may contain social interaction but strong internal anxiety.
- Avoid including strong avoidance behavior.

For other:
- Some samples may include stress or irritation but without dominant fear.
- Some samples may include anger mixed with social interaction.
- Avoid accidental fear-like phrasing unless anxiety is dominant.


Reason requirements:
- Mention cues such as behavior, thoughts, avoidance, tone, or context.
- Do not simply restate the label.

Language requirements:
- "text" must be written entirely in Persian.
- "reason" must also be written entirely in Persian.
- Do NOT use English words in the reason.
- Do NOT mix languages.

Output strictly as JSON array:
[
  {{
    "text": "...",
    "reason": "...",
    "label": "..."
  }}
]
