Generate {n_samples} Persian samples for emotion classification.

Target labels:
- Withdrawal
- fear
- other

Detailed label definitions:

Withdrawal:
Texts where the person shows behavioral or psychological withdrawal from social interaction or participation.

Typical signals include:
- Avoiding meetings, gatherings, or conversations
- Ignoring messages or calls
- Preferring isolation over interaction
- Canceling plans repeatedly
- Feeling too tired or unwilling to interact with others
- Emotional distancing from friends or family
- Desire to stay alone instead of joining social activities

Important notes:
- Withdrawal focuses on avoidance behavior, not necessarily sadness or fear.
- Person may not explicitly say they are avoiding people; avoidance can be implied.
- Social disengagement or reduced participation is key.

fear:
Texts where fear, anxiety, worry, or anticipation of danger or negative outcomes is dominant.

Typical signals include:
- Fear of events, situations, or outcomes
- Anxiety about health, work, future, or safety
- Physical or emotional tension caused by worry
- Expectation that something bad might happen
- Nervousness or panic before events
- Fear-driven hesitation or stress

Important notes:
- Fear may be explicit or implied.
- Anxiety about uncertain outcomes counts as fear.
- Fear does not require social withdrawal; it can occur while still interacting socially.

other:
Texts that do not clearly express Withdrawal or fear.

Typical examples include:
- Neutral daily experiences
- Happiness, sadness, anger, excitement, nostalgia, or mixed emotions
- Descriptions without dominant fear or social avoidance
- Normal social participation without avoidance signals

Important notes:
- Use this label only when fear or withdrawal cues are absent or weak.
- If signals are ambiguous, prefer "other".


Dataset requirements:

Each sample must contain:
- "text": natural Persian text
- "reason": explanation showing how emotion is inferred
- "label": one label from the list above

Text diversity requirements:
- Mix short, medium, and longer texts.
- Include direct and indirect emotional expression.
- Use diverse daily-life contexts:
  work, family, school, friendship, loneliness, uncertainty, home, street, social media chat, online forum, etc.
- Some samples should express emotion subtly.
- Avoid repeated scenarios or sentence openings.

Reason requirements:
- Mention cues such as behavior, thoughts, avoidance, tone, or context.
- Do not simply restate the label.

Output strictly as JSON array:
